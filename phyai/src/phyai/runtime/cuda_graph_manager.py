"""CUDA-graph capture / replay primitives shared by every model runner.

A :class:`CudaGraph` owns one captured ``torch.cuda.CUDAGraph`` plus its
static input buffers. Each runner's ``forward`` resolves to the same
two-step sequence:

    1. ``graph.input_buffer(name).copy_(actual_input)``  per input
    2. ``graph.replay()``                                # captured kernels run

The output tensors returned by the captured ``fn`` are themselves static
(allocated inside the capture region) and refilled every replay; the
runner reads them by reference.

The capture path follows the standard PyTorch warmup pattern: run the
function on a side stream a few times so the CUDA-caching allocator
finalises every workspace before capture, then enter the graph context
and run once more to record the kernel sequence.

Multiple shape buckets — e.g. one graph per padded prefix length — are
managed by :class:`CudaGraphRegistry`, a small key->graph dict so the
runner can pick the right graph at replay time without an ``if`` ladder.

Captureability of external state
--------------------------------
The captured ``fn`` may freely call into non-graph-aware code (e.g.
:func:`flashinfer.prefill.BatchPrefillWithPagedKVCacheWrapper.run`) as
long as every kernel launch reads from / writes to tensors with stable
storage between captures. Any metadata buffer the kernels read (paged
KV indices, etc.) must therefore be **pre-allocated once** by the
caller and updated in place via ``.copy_()`` rather than reassigned.
The ``flashinfer`` wrapper supports exactly this when constructed with
``use_cuda_graph=True`` and the four ``paged_kv_*_buf`` arguments. The
:class:`CudaGraph` itself is agnostic to that contract — it just hands
control to ``fn`` inside the capture region.

class CudaGraph:
    """A single captured graph with its static input buffers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_warmup_iters:
        How many side-stream warmup iterations to run before capture.
        Three is enough to flush every workspace allocation flashinfer
        and friends do on their first call. Bumped to four when capture
        ever races against a JIT autotuner.
    mempool:
        Optional ``torch.cuda.MemPool`` to share allocations across
        multiple graphs (so they can each free buffers without breaking
        the other captures). Defaults to a fresh per-graph pool.

    Lifecycle
    ---------
    ::

        graph = CudaGraph()
        graph.capture(fn, example_inputs)   # one-shot
        out   = graph.replay(actual_inputs)  # called many times

    Re-capturing into the same instance is rejected — construct a new
    one for the new shape (or use :class:`CudaGraphRegistry`).

    Output references
    -----------------
    :meth:`replay` returns whatever ``fn`` returned at capture time.
    Nested structures are returned by reference; tensor storage is
    stable across replays, so callers should ``.clone()`` outputs they
    intend to retain past the next replay.
