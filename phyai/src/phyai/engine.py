"""Process-level engine that drives a single registered model plugin.

The :class:`Engine` is a thin programmatic dispatcher; it does *not*
parse argv or read environment variables. A future server (HTTP /
gRPC / RPC / ...) is expected to wrap this engine, translate external
requests into a model-specific request object, and call
:meth:`Engine.step`. Until that server lands, the intended caller is
in-process Python (tests, scripts, notebooks).

Three concepts:

* :class:`EntryArgs` — empty dataclass base. Each plugin declares a
  subclass with its own fields (e.g. ``PI05Args(checkpoint_dir=...)``).
  EntryArgs are programmatic: typed, defaulted, IDE-friendly. No
  argparse, no string parsing.
* :class:`Entry` — ABC every plugin inherits. Defines :meth:`setup`
  (build model + scheduler from args), :meth:`step` (one inference
  round; request / response shapes are plugin-defined), and
  :meth:`close` (release GPU resources).
* :class:`Engine` — owns the plugin registry, applies
  :class:`~phyai.engine_config.EngineConfig` so every downstream model
  constructor picks up the same defaults, and orchestrates a fixed
  sequence of discrete ``init_*`` functions
  (:func:`~phyai.engine_config.init_engine_config`,
  :func:`~phyai.utils.cuda.init_cuda`,
  :func:`~phyai.utils.cuda.init_cublas`,
  :func:`~phyai.parallel.dist.init_dist`,
  :func:`phyai.parallel.init`,
  :func:`phyai.layers.linear.init`) in :meth:`__init__`. Each ``init_*``
  is independently callable so tests / advanced users can opt into
  pieces without committing to the full sequence.

Plugin discovery is explicit: this module imports each plugin's
``main_*`` module at the bottom of the file, which in turn invokes
``@Engine.register`` at class-definition time. To add a new model,
add one import line at the bottom of this file.
