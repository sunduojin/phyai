"""Backend implementations.

Currently registered:
  * :class:`NcclBackend`     — torch.distributed on NCCL PGs (eager + graph)
  * :class:`GlooBackend`     — torch.distributed on gloo PGs (eager only)
  * :class:`PyNCCLBackend`   — direct ctypes call to libnccl (graph-mode pref)

``can_handle`` of each backend gates on the PG's actual backend type so
they never fight over the same PG. Registration order in ``init`` decides
which one wins when multiple are eligible (e.g., NcclBackend vs PyNCCL on
the same NCCL PG; PyNCCL wins under capture).

``TorchDistBackend`` is exported as an alias for ``NcclBackend``.
