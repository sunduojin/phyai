"""pi0.5 text/state ops — state binning + prompt assembly (openpi/PaliGemma).

These encode pi0.5's *specific* state-tokenization convention (mirrors openpi's
``PaligemmaTokenizer.tokenize()``): a ``[-1, 1]``-normalized state vector is
discretized into 256 integer bins and embedded in the prompt template
``"Task: <task>, State: <bins>;\\nAction: "``. The bin scheme and the template
are pi0.5-specific, so they live under ``models/pi05`` rather than the generic
``processing`` tree. The generic HF tokenization that consumes the prompt is
:class:`~phyai_utils_tools.processing.steps.text_steps.TokenizerStep`.
